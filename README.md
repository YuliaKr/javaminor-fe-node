Code is making use of MongoDB, so to run it locally (posting and updating form) you need to have it installed (possibly update the connection string in app.js).

Solution serves static HTML files using Express. 

To run application MongoDB should be installed and connection string needs to be changed in app.js file. 

Command to start the application: node app.js

To serve overview of the accounts Embedded JS was used to render data in HTML.

Username: test@test.nl, password: topsecret

Commands to run:
npm install
node app.js

Cheers,
